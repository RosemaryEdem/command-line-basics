## Week 2 Updates: Git and GitHub

In Week 2, I integrated version control using Git to manage the project files created in Week 1.

### Commands Used
* git clone: Cloned the repository to a new folder to practice remote collaboration.
* touch goals.txt: Created a new file to document programming goals for Cloud Engineering.
* git add goals.txt: Staged the new file for the next commit.
* git commit -m "Added goals.txt file": Saved the changes locally with a descriptive message.
* git push: Sent the local updates to the remote GitHub repository.

### Git Workflow Verification
I verified the push by checking the repository on GitHub to ensure `goals.txt` was visible in the file list.
